# Guess-Battle
A multiplayer number guessing game using C++
My first C++ Project – Number Guessing Game! 🚀

I’ve created a fun and interactive game in C++ where 3 players compete to guess a number! The system randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and each player takes turns guessing. The player whose guess is closest to the system’s number gets the next chance first. The game keeps going until one player guesses the exact number and wins! 🏆🎉

Key highlights of the project:
✔️ The system automatically generates a random number using rand()
✔️ It compares each player’s guess with the actual number using abs() to find the closest guess
✔️ Dynamic turns based on which guess is closest
✔️ Real-time interaction and winner announcement

Through this project, I improved my skills in:
✅ Functions and modular coding
✅ Handling user inputs and loops
✅ Implementing game logic and debugging

This is a perfect beginner-friendly project for those learning C++ and wanting to practice logical thinking while having fun!

Feel free to try it out, give feedback, or suggest improvements! Let’s keep building and learning together. 💡💻
